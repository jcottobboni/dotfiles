# Dotfiles

This is my system configuration for Ubuntu consisting of config "dotfiles" and shell scripts.

## Usage

- Clone this repo to a directory in the $HOME folder;
- Run `cd dotfiles`
- Run `./execute.sh install`.  This command will install all the settings
- Run `./execute.sh activate`.  This command will create a symlink in config files to configs in dotfiles
